## Design Philosophy

This project was inspired by the principles of modern UI/UX design, emphasizing:

- **Simplicity**: Clean, minimalist interface that puts focus on the colors
- **Accessibility**: High contrast and clear visual hierarchy
- **Interactivity**: Smooth animations and immediate feedback
- **Responsiveness**: Seamless experience across all device sizes

## Color Theory

The application's own design uses a carefully selected color palette:

- **Background**: Soft blue (#f0f7ff) - Creates a calm, professional atmosphere
- **Primary**: Deep blue (#2d5b8e) - Ensures readability and establishes hierarchy
- **Accent**: Pink (#ff69b4) - Adds personality and draws attention to interactive elements
- **Secondary**: Light blue (#91c4ff) - Provides subtle depth and dimension
